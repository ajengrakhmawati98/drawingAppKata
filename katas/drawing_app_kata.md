# Drawing Application

We're embarking on an ambitious journey to create a drawing application set to disrupt the market. 
Our first step is to model the domain, laying the groundwork with basic geometric shapes. 
By integrating object-oriented programming principles and Test-Driven Development from the outset, we're not just coding; 
we're crafting the foundation of an innovative tool. 
Lets begin this exciting venture, starting with the essentials and building towards a groundbreaking drawing application.

## Step 1: Exploring Geometric Shapes
Our drawing application kicks off with an exploration of **Rectangles** and **Triangles**, **shapes** fundamentally defined by the lengths of their sides.
Beyond their ability to calculate area and perimeter, these shapes detail the length of their side.

## Step 2: Enriching Our Collection of Shapes
Following the encouraging feedback on our initial efforts with **Rectangles** and **Triangles**, we're excited to expand our repertoire. 
It's time to enrich our collection of geometric shapes by introducing **Squares** and **Circles**. 
These new additions not only diversify the shapes available in our drawing application but also challenge us to think about how different properties, like a square's uniform sides or a circle's radius, fit into our existing Shape concept. 
As we evolve our application, these shapes will further illustrate the versatility and adaptability of our design, inviting even more creativity and functionality.

## Step 3: Introducing Coordinates to Shapes
Building on our expanding collection of geometric shapes, the next enhancement focuses on spatial orientationâ€”every shape will now be associated with a coordinate (x,y). 
This addition is crucial for positioning our shapes within the drawing canvas, allowing us to specify not just the characteristics of each shape but also its precise location. 
Incorporating coordinates into our shapes brings us closer to simulating real drawing experiences, where placement and layout play as significant a role as the shapes themselves.

## Step 4: Moving Shapes
Now that our shapes have coordinates, we introduce the ability to move them. 
By adjusting their position, shapes become dynamic elements that users can reposition, enhancing the interactive experience of our drawing application.

## Step 5: Resizing and Coloring Shapes
Next, we make our shapes resizable and colorable. 
Users can now adjust the size of any shape and choose from a limited palette of colors to apply. 
This step not only adds visual variety but also increases the flexibility of design within the application, allowing for more personalized and creative expressions.

## Step 6: Custom Shapes with Flexible Sides
We're taking a leap by enabling users to create custom shapes with any number of sides, a feature that dramatically widens creative horizons. 
Alongside area and perimeter, the number of sides becomes accessible information, ready to be displayed. 
This addition not only fosters creativity but also enriches the detail and information shared about each unique shape.

## Step 7: Shape Container Feature
We add a game-changing feature: a container for shapes, enabling users to group and manipulate multiple shapes as one unit. 
This enhances creative flexibility and marks a significant evolution in our drawing application.
