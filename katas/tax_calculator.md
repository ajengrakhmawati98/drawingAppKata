# Kata â€“ Tax Calculation

A value-added tax of 10% is applied to each product, except for books, food, and medicine, which are exempt.

An additional tax of 5% is applied to imported products, without exception.

The amount of each tax is rounded up to the nearest 5 cents, according to the following rule:

| Calculated Tax | Imposed Tax	 | 
|----------------|--------------|
| 0.99	          | 1.00         |
| 1.01           | 1.02         |
| 1.00	          | 1.00         |
| 1.05	          | 1.05         |

When placing an order, an invoice is issued listing each product along with its price including taxes; at the bottom of
the invoice are the total price (including taxes) and the total amount of taxes.
The total price including taxes is calculated as follows:

> Ptotal = PWithout Tax + sum(rounded(PWithout Tax * Tax/100))
